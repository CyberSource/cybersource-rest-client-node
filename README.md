# Node.JS Client SDK for the CyberSource REST API

## Description

The CyberSource Node client provides convenient access to the [CyberSource REST API](https://developer.cybersource.com/api/reference/api-reference.html) from your Node application.

## System Requirements

* Node.js version 14.21.3 or higher.

## Installation

```shell
    npm install cybersource-rest-client
```

## Account Registration and Configuration

* Account Registration

Follow the first step mentioned in [Getting Started with CyberSource REST SDKs](https://developer.cybersource.com/hello-world/rest-api-sdks.html#gettingstarted) to create a sandbox account.

* Configuration

Follow the second step mentioned in [Getting Started with CyberSource REST SDKs](https://developer.cybersource.com/hello-world/rest-api-sdks.html#gettingstarted) to configure the SDK by inputting your credentials.

## How to Use

To get started using this SDK, it's highly recommended to download our sample code repository:

* [Cybersource Node.js Sample Code Repository (on GitHub)](https://github.com/CyberSource/cybersource-rest-samples-node)

In that respository, we have comprehensive sample code for all common uses of our API:

Additionally, you can find details and examples of how our API is structured in our API Reference Guide:

* [Developer Center API Reference](https://developer.cybersource.com/api/reference/api-reference.html)

The API Reference Guide provides examples of what information is needed for a particular request and how that information would be formatted. Using those examples, you can easily determine what methods would be necessary to include that information in a request using this SDK.

### Example using Sample Code Application

* Add the [CyberSource REST client as a dependency](https://github.com/CyberSource/cybersource-rest-samples-node/blob/2dceb63f2fc5eb01150d1c7a9d935b291f52012f/package.json#L16C5-L16C41) in your Node.JS project.
* Configure your credentials in a [Config Object](https://github.com/CyberSource/cybersource-rest-samples-node/blob/2dceb63f2fc5eb01150d1c7a9d935b291f52012f/Data/Configuration.js#L40C1-L70C2).
* Create an instance of [ApiClient](https://github.com/CyberSource/cybersource-rest-samples-node/blob/2dceb63f2fc5eb01150d1c7a9d935b291f52012f/Samples/Payments/Payments/simple-authorizationinternet.js#L11).
* Use the created ApiClient instance to call CyberSource APIs. For example [SimpleAuthorizationInternet](https://github.com/CyberSource/cybersource-rest-samples-node/blob/2dceb63f2fc5eb01150d1c7a9d935b291f52012f/Samples/Payments/Payments/simple-authorizationinternet.js#L56C3-L71C6)

For more detailed examples, refer to the [cybersource-rest-samples-node](https://github.com/CyberSource/cybersource-rest-samples-node) repository.

### Switching between Test environment and Production environment

CyberSource maintains a complete sandbox environment for testing and development purposes. This sandbox environment is an exact duplicate of our production environment with the transaction authorization and settlement process simulated. By default, this SDK is configured to communicate with the sandbox environment. To switch to the production environment, set the `runEnvironment` in the SDK Configuration.  See our sample at <https://github.com/CyberSource/cybersource-rest-samples-node/blob/master/Data/Configuration.js>.

```javascript
    // For TESTING use
    const RunEnvironment = "apitest.cybersource.com";
    // For PRODUCTION use
    const RunEnvironment = "api.cybersource.com";
```

API credentials are different for each environment, so be sure to switch to the appropriate credentials when switching environments.

## Logging

[![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/LOGGING-NEW-GREEN.svg)](https://shields.io/)

Since v0.0.35, a new logging framework has been introduced in the SDK. This new logging framework makes use of Winston, and standardizes the logging so that it can be integrated with the logging in the client application.

More information about this new logging framework can be found in this file : [Logging.md](Logging.md)

## Features

### MetaKey Support

A Meta Key is a single key that can be used by one, some, or all merchants (or accounts, if created by a Portfolio user) in the portfolio.

The Portfolio or Parent Account owns the key and is considered the transaction submitter when a Meta Key is used, while the merchant owns the transaction.

MIDs continue to be able to create keys for themselves, even if a Meta Key is generated.

Further information on MetaKey can be found in [New Business Center User Guide](https://developer.cybersource.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/Business_Center/New_Business_Center_User_Guide.pdf).
