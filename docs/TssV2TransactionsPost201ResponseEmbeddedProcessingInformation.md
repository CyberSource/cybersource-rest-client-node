For valid values, see the &#x60;invoiceHeader_businessApplicationID&#x60; field description in [Payouts Using the Simple Order API.](http://apps.cybersource.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/payouts_SO/Payouts_SO_API.pdf)  | [optional]

The list of valid values in this field depends on your processor. See Appendix I, \&quot;Commerce Indicators,\&quot; on page 441 of the Cybersource Credit Card Guide.  #### Ingenico ePayments When you omit this field for Ingenico ePayments, the processor uses the default transaction type they have on file for you instead of the default value (listed in Appendix I, \&quot;Commerce Indicators,\&quot; on page 441.)  #### Payer Authentication Transactions For the possible values and requirements, see \&quot;Payer Authentication,\&quot; page 195.  #### Card Present You must set this field to &#x60;retail&#x60;.
