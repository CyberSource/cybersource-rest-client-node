As a result, you will not receive American Express AVS codes for the American Express card type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  _American Express Card codes_: &#x60;F&#x60;, &#x60;H&#x60;, &#x60;K&#x60;, &#x60;L&#x60;, &#x60;O&#x60;, &#x60;T&#x60;, &#x60;V&#x60;  #### Domestic and International Visa Cards The international and domestic alphabetic AVS codes are the Visa standard AVS codes. CyberSource maps the standard AVS return codes for other types of payment cards, including American Express cards, to the Visa standard AVS codes.  AVS is considered either domestic or international, depending on the location of the bank that issued the customer&#39;s payment card: - When the bank is in the U.S., the AVS is domestic. - When the bank is outside the U.S., the AVS is international.  You should be prepared to handle both domestic and international AVS result codes: - For international cards, you can receive domestic AVS codes in addition to the international AVS codes. - For domestic cards, you can receive international AVS codes in addition to the domestic AVS codes.  _International Visa Codes_: &#x60;B&#x60;, &#x60;C&#x60;, &#x60;D&#x60;, &#x60;G&#x60;, &#x60;I&#x60;, &#x60;M&#x60;, &#x60;P&#x60;  _Domestic Visa Codes_: &#x60;A&#x60;, &#x60;E&#x60;,&#x60;N&#x60;, &#x60;R&#x60;, &#x60;S&#x60;, &#x60;U&#x60;, &#x60;W&#x60;, &#x60;X&#x60;, &#x60;Y&#x60;, &#x60;Z&#x60;  #### CyberSource Codes The numeric AVS codes are created by CyberSource and are not standard Visa codes. These AVS codes can be returned for any card type.  _CyberSource Codes_: &#x60;1&#x60;, &#x60;2&#x60;, &#x60;3&#x60;, &#x60;4&#x60;  ### Table of AVS Codes for All Other Processors  |AVS Code|Description| |--- |--- | |A|Partial match: street address matches, but 5-digit and 9-digit postal codes do not match.| |B|Partial match: street address matches, but postal code is not verified.
