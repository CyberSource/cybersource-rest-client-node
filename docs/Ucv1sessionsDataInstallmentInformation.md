**sequence** | **Number** | Installment number when making payments in installments. Used along with `totalCount` to track which payment is being processed.  For example, the second of 5 payments would be passed to CyberSource as `sequence` = 2 and `totalCount` = 5.  #### Chase Paymentech Solutions and FDC Compass This field is optional because this value is required in the merchant descriptors.  #### CyberSource through VisaNet When you do not include this field in a request for a Crediario installment payment, CyberSource sends a value of 0 to the processor.  For Crediario installment payments, the value for this field corresponds to the following data in the TC 33 capture file*: - Record: CP01 TCR9 - Position: 38-40 - Field: Installment Payment Number  * The TC 33 Capture file contains information about the purchases and refunds that a merchant submits to CyberSource. CyberSource through VisaNet creates the TC 33 Capture file at the end of the day and sends it to the merchant's acquirer, who uses this information to facilitate end-of-day clearing processing with payment card companies.  | [optional]
