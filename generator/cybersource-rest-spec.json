CyberSource maps\nthe standard AVS return codes for other types of payment cards, including American Express cards, to\nthe Visa standard AVS codes.\n\nAVS is considered either domestic or international, depending on the location of the bank that issued the\ncustomer's payment card:\n- When the bank is in the U.S., the AVS is domestic.\n- When the bank is outside the U.S., the AVS is international.\n\nYou should be prepared to handle both domestic and international AVS result codes:\n- For international cards, you can receive domestic AVS codes in addition to the international AVS codes.\n- For domestic cards, you can receive international AVS codes in addition to the domestic AVS codes.\n\n_International Visa Codes_: `B`, `C`, `D`, `G`, `I`, `M`, `P`\n\n_Domestic Visa Codes_: `A`, `E`,`N`, `R`, `S`, `U`, `W`, `X`, `Y`, `Z`\n\n#### CyberSource Codes\nThe numeric AVS codes are created by CyberSource\nand are not standard Visa codes. These AVS codes\ncan be returned for any card type.\n\n_CyberSource Codes_: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`\n\n### Table of AVS Codes for All Other Processors\n\n|AVS Code|Description|\n|--- |--- |\n|A|Partial match: street address matches, but 5-digit and 9-digit postal codes do not match.|\n|B|Partial match: street address matches, but postal code is not verified.

In the CyberSource API documentation, CyberSource Latin American Processing does not refer to the general topic of processing in Latin America. The information in this section is for the specific processing connection called CyberSource Latin American Processing. It is not for any other Latin American processors that CyberSource supports.\n\n|AVS Code|Description|\n|--- |--- |\n|D|Partial match: postal code and address match.|\n|E|Not supported: AVS is not supported for this card type. _or_ Invalid: the acquirer returned an unrecognized value for the AVS response.|\n|F|Partial match: postal code matches, but CPF and address do not match.*|\n|G|Not supported: AVS not supported or not verified.|\n|I|No match: AVS information is not available.|\n|K|Partial match: CPF matches, but postal code and address do not match.*|\n|L|Partial match: postal code and CPF match, but address does not match.*|\n|N|No match: postal code, CPF, and address do not match.*|\n|O|Partial match: CPF and address match, but postal code does not match.*|\n|R|Not supported: your implementation does not support AVS _or_ System unavailable.|\n|T|Partial match: address matches, but postal code and CPF do not match.*|\n|V|Match: postal code, CPF, and address match.*|\n|* CPF (Cadastro de Pessoas Fisicas) is required only for Redecard in Brazil.||\n\n### AVS Codes for All Other Processors\n\n**Note** The list of AVS codes for all other processors follows these descriptions of the processor-specific information for these codes.\n\n#### American Express Cards\nFor American Express cards only, you can receive Visa and CyberSource AVS codes in addition to the American Express AVS codes.\n\n**Note** For CyberSource through VisaNet, the American Express AVS codes are converted to Visa AVS codes before they are returned to you. As a result, you will not receive American Express AVS codes for the American Express card type.\n\n_American Express Card codes_: `F`, `H`, `K`, `L`, `O`, `T`, `V`\n\n#### Domestic and International Visa Cards\nThe international and domestic alphabetic AVS codes are the Visa standard AVS codes. CyberSource maps the standard AVS return codes for other types of payment cards, including American Express cards, to the Visa standard AVS codes.\n\nAVS is considered either domestic or international, depending on the location of the bank that issued the customer\u2019s payment card:\n- When the bank is in the U.S., the AVS is domestic.\n- When the bank is outside the U.S., the AVS is international.\n\nYou should be prepared to handle both domestic and international AVS result codes:\n- For international cards, you can receive domestic AVS codes in addition to the international AVS codes.\n- For domestic cards, you can receive international AVS codes in addition to the domestic AVS codes.\n\n_International Visa Codes_: `B`, `C`, `D`, `G`, `I`, `M`, `P`\n\n_Domestic Visa Codes_: `A`, `E`,`N`, `R`, `S`, `U`, `W`, `X`, `Y`, `Z`\n\n#### CyberSource Codes\nThe numeric AVS codes are created by CyberSource and are not standard Visa codes. These AVS codes can be returned for any card type.\n\n_CyberSource Codes_: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`\n\n### Table of AVS Codes for All Other Processors\n\n|AVS Code|Description|\n|--- |--- |\n|A|Partial match: street address matches, but 5-digit and 9-digit postal codes do not match.|\n|B|Partial match: street address matches, but postal code is not verified.

See these guides for details:\n- [Merchant Descriptors Using the SCMP API Guide]\n(https://apps.cybersource.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/Merchant_Descriptors_SCMP_API/html/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm)\n- \"Capture Information for Specific Processors\" section in the [Credit Card Services Using the SCMP API Guide](https://apps.cybersource.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/CC_Svcs_SCMP_API/html/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm)\n\n#### DCC with a Third-Party Provider\nSet this field to the converted amount that was returned by the DCC provider. You must include either\nthe 1st line item in the order and this field, or the request-level field `orderInformation.amountDetails.totalAmount` in your request. For details, see \"Dynamic Currency Conversion with a Third Party\nProvider\" in the [Credit Card Services Using the SCMP API Guide.](https://apps.cybersource.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/CC_Svcs_SCMP_API/html/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm)\n\n#### FDMS South\nIf you accept IDR or CLP currencies, see the entry for FDMS South in the [Merchant Descriptors Using the SCMP API Guide.]\n(https://apps.cybersource.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/Merchant_Descriptors_SCMP_API/html/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm)\n\n#### Zero Amount Authorizations\nIf your processor supports zero amount authorizations, you can set this field to 0 for the\nauthorization to check if the card is lost or stolen. See \"Zero Amount Authorizations\" in the [Credit Card Services Using the SCMP API Guide.](https://apps.cybersource.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/CC_Svcs_SCMP_API/html/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm)\n"

If the concatenated value exceeds 30 characters, CyberSource Latin American Processing declines the authorization request.\\\n**Note** CyberSource Latin American Processing is the name of a specific processing connection that CyberSource supports. In the CyberSource API documentation, CyberSource Latin American Processing does not refer to the general topic of processing in Latin America. The information in this field description is for the specific processing connection called _CyberSource Latin American Processing_. It is not for any other Latin American processors that CyberSource supports.\n\n#### CyberSource through VisaNet\nCredit card networks cannot process transactions that contain non-ASCII characters. CyberSource through VisaNet accepts and stores non-ASCII characters correctly and displays them correctly in reports. However, the limitations of the credit card networks prevent CyberSource through VisaNet from transmitting non-ASCII characters to the credit card networks.

CyberSource through VisaNet accepts and stores non-ASCII characters correctly and displays them correctly in reports. However, the limitations of the credit card networks prevent CyberSource through VisaNet from transmitting non-ASCII characters to the credit card networks. Therefore, CyberSource through VisaNet replaces non-ASCII characters with meaningless ASCII characters for transmission to the credit card networks.\n\nFor processor-specific information, see the `bill_zip` request-level field description in\n[Credit Card Services Using the SCMP API.](http://apps.cybersource.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/CC_Svcs_SCMP_API/html)\n"
