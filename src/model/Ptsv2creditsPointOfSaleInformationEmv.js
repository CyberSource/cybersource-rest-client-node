PIN debit processing is available only on FDC Nashville Global.  **Note** For information about the individual tags, see the “Application Specification” section in the EMV 4.3 Specifications: http://emvco.com  **Important** The following tags contain sensitive information and **must not** be included in this field:   - **56**: Track 1 equivalent data  - **57**: Track 2 equivalent data  - **5A**: Application PAN  - **5F20**: Cardholder name  - **5F24**: Application expiration date (This sensitivity has been relaxed for cmcic, amexdirect, fdiglobal, opdfde, and six)  - **99**: Transaction PIN  - **9F0B**: Cardholder name (extended)  - **9F1F**: Track 1 discretionary data  - **9F20**: Track 2 discretionary data  For captures, this field is required for contact EMV transactions.

   * Reason for the EMV fallback transaction. An EMV fallback transaction occurs when an EMV transaction fails for one of these reasons:   - Technical failure: the EMV terminal or EMV card cannot read and process chip data.  - Empty candidate list failure: the EMV terminal does not have any applications in common with the EMV card.    EMV terminals are coded to determine whether the terminal and EMV card have any applications in common.    EMV terminals provide this information to you.  Possible values:   - **1**: Transaction was initiated with information from a magnetic stripe, and the previous transaction at the       EMV terminal either used information from a successful chip read or it was not a chip transaction.  - **2**: Transaction was initiated with information from a magnetic stripe, and the previous transaction at the       EMV terminal was an EMV fallback transaction because the attempted chip read was unsuccessful.  This field is supported only on **GPN**.  **NOTE**: This field is required when an EMV transaction fails for a technical reason. Do not include this field when the EMV terminal does not have any applications in common with the EMV card.
