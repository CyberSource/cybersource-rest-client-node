An EMV fallback transaction occurs when an EMV transaction fails for one of these reasons:   - Technical failure: the EMV terminal or EMV card cannot read and process chip data.  - Empty candidate list failure: the EMV terminal does not have any applications in common with the EMV card.    EMV terminals are coded to determine whether the terminal and EMV card have any applications in common.    EMV terminals provide this information to you.  Possible values:   - **1**: Transaction was initiated with information from a magnetic stripe, and the previous transaction at the       EMV terminal either used information from a successful chip read or it was not a chip transaction.  - **2**: Transaction was initiated with information from a magnetic stripe, and the previous transaction at the       EMV terminal was an EMV fallback transaction because the attempted chip read was unsuccessful.  This field is supported only on **GPN**.  **NOTE**: Merchants must include this field in a request whenever a transaction must fall back to swiped mode.
