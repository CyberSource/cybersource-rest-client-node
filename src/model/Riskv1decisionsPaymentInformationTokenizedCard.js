For card-present transactions on all processors except SIX, the Visa Electron card type is processed the same way that the Visa debit card is processed.

[^2]: For this card type on Cielo 3.0, you must include the `paymentInformation.card.type` or `paymentInformation.tokenizedCard.type` field in a request for an authorization or a stand-alone credit. This card type is not supported on Cielo 1.5.

Optional for all other card types.  #### Card Present reply This field is included in the reply message when the client software that is installed on the POS terminal uses the token management service (TMS) to retrieve tokenized payment details.
