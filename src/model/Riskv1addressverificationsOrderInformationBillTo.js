   * @param address1 {String} Payment card billing street address as it appears on the credit card issuer’s records.  #### Atos This field must not contain colons (:).  #### CyberSource through VisaNet **Important** When you populate billing street address 1 and billing street address 2, CyberSource through VisaNet concatenates the two values. If the concatenated value exceeds 40 characters, CyberSource through VisaNet truncates the value at 40 characters before sending it to Visa and the issuing bank. Truncating this value affects AVS results and therefore might also affect risk decisions and chargebacks. Credit card networks cannot process transactions that contain non-ASCII characters. CyberSource through VisaNet accepts and stores non-ASCII characters correctly and displays them correctly in reports. However, the limitations of the credit card networks prevent CyberSource through VisaNet from transmitting non-ASCII characters to the credit card networks. Therefore, CyberSource through VisaNet replaces non-ASCII characters with meaningless ASCII characters for transmission to the credit card networks.  #### For Payouts: This field may be sent only for FDC Compass.  **Important** It is your responsibility to determine whether a field is required for the transaction you are requesting.

When the billing country is the U.S., the 9-digit postal code must follow this format: [5 digits][dash][4 digits]  **Example** `12345-6789`  When the billing country is Canada, the 6-digit postal code must follow this format: [alpha][numeric][alpha][space][numeric][alpha][numeric]  **Example** `A1B 2C3`  **Important** It is your responsibility to determine whether a field is required for the transaction you are requesting.  #### For Payouts:  This field may be sent only for FDC Compass.  #### American Express Direct Before sending the postal code to the processor, CyberSource removes all nonalphanumeric characters and, if the remaining value is longer than nine characters, truncates the value starting from the right side.  #### Atos This field must not contain colons (:).  #### CyberSource through VisaNet Credit card networks cannot process transactions that contain non-ASCII characters.
