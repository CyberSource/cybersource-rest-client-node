   * @param address1 {String} Payment card billing street address as it appears on the credit card issuer’s records.  #### Atos This field must not contain colons (:).  #### CyberSource through VisaNet **Important** When you populate orderInformation.billTo.address1 and orderInformation.billTo.address2, CyberSource through VisaNet concatenates the two values. If the concatenated value exceeds 40 characters, CyberSource through VisaNet truncates the value at 40 characters before sending it to Visa and the issuing bank. Truncating this value affects AVS results and therefore might also affect risk decisions and chargebacks. Credit card networks cannot process transactions that contain non-ASCII characters. CyberSource through VisaNet accepts and stores non-ASCII characters correctly and displays them correctly in reports. However, the limitations of the credit card networks prevent CyberSource through VisaNet from transmitting non-ASCII characters to the credit card networks. Therefore, CyberSource through VisaNet replaces non-ASCII characters with meaningless ASCII characters for transmission to the credit card networks.  #### FDMS Nashville When the street name is numeric, it must be sent in numeric format. For example, if the address is _One First Street_, it must be sent as _1 1st Street_.  Required if keyed; not used if swiped.  String (20)  #### TSYS Acquiring Solutions Required when `processingInformation.billPaymentOptions.billPayment=true` and `pointOfSaleInformation.entryMode=keyed`.  #### All other processors: Optional. String (60)  #### For Payouts This field may be sent only for FDC Compass.  **Important** It is your responsibility to determine whether a field is required for the transaction you are requesting. 
   * @param country {String} Payment card billing country. Use the two-character [ISO Standard Country Codes](http://apps.cybersource.com/library/documentation/sbc/quickref/countries_alpha_list.pdf).  #### CyberSource through VisaNet Credit card networks cannot process transactions that contain non-ASCII characters. CyberSource through VisaNet accepts and stores non-ASCII characters correctly and displays them correctly in reports.

   * @param locality {String} Payment card billing city.  #### Atos This field must not contain colons (:).  #### CyberSource through VisaNet Credit card networks cannot process transactions that contain non-ASCII characters.

   * @param postalCode {String} Postal code for the billing address. The postal code must consist of 5 to 9 digits.  When the billing country is the U.S., the 9-digit postal code must follow this format: [5 digits][dash][4 digits]  **Example** `12345-6789`  When the billing country is Canada, the 6-digit postal code must follow this format: [alpha][numeric][alpha][space][numeric][alpha][numeric]  **Example** `A1B 2C3`  **Important** It is your responsibility to determine whether a field is required for the transaction you are requesting.  #### For Payouts:  This field may be sent only for FDC Compass.  #### American Express Direct Before sending the postal code to the processor, CyberSource removes all nonalphanumeric characters and, if the remaining value is longer than nine characters, truncates the value starting from the right side.  #### Atos This field must not contain colons (:).  #### CyberSource through VisaNet Credit card networks cannot process transactions that contain non-ASCII characters.

Not used if swiped.  #### RBS WorldPay Atlanta: For best card-present keyed rates, send the postal code if `pointOfSaleInformation.entryMode=keyed`.  #### TSYS Acquiring Solutions Required when `processingInformation.billPaymentOptions.billPayment=true` and `pointOfSaleInformation.entryMode=keyed`.  #### All other processors: Optional field.
